The wc command allows you to count the lines, words and characters in an output (eg. a file), but also from the output passed
to it via a preceeding stream (pipe)
It can be used on it's own or with parameters
  wc      returns 3 numbers; lines, words, characters
  wc -l   returns just the number of lines
  wc -w   returns just the number of words
  wc -c   returns just the number of characters
