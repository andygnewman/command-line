The cp command means copy file and has two parameters current location/file name (if location plan defaults to working directory)
and new location/new file name
For example 
    cp oldFile newFile would create a copy of oldFile, called newFile, in the current working directory
If you wanted to copy it into a different location (eg. parent directory) you could do;
    cp oldFile ../newFile
